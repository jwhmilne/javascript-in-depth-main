/*
    1. Create a variable called "loggedIn" that starts off as false.
    2. Create a for loop that loops while "loggedIn" is false.
    3. Each loop, print out: "Incorrect login credentials"
    3. After 3 loop iterations, change "loggedIn" to be true.
    4. After the loops is done print out: "Sucessfully logged in!"

    HINT1: This is more challenging with a for loop
    HINT2: This is not an ideal candidate for a for loop!
    HINT3: You don't have to provide all parts of the for loop construct
