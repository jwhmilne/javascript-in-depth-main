    1. Create an array called "numbers" with the following values:
    [10, 20, 15, 30, 15, 20, 35, 60, 10]

    2. Find the first duplicate value in "numbers" and print out the INDEX of that value as well as the INDEX of where it was first found in "numbers"

    3. In this case, we will print:
        4 2

        (4 is where the duplicate index was)
        (2 is where the firstr pair of that duplicate was, as an index)

    HINT: Use a Map to keep track of numberâž”index pairs

    *This is very challenging and is a common interview question
